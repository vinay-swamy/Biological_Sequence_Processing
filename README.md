# Biological_Sequence_Processing
This is my Final project for the FAES deeplearning in healthcare course. 
## Project Overview 
The goal of this project is to apply techniques from natural language processing to analyze Biological sequences.

## Stratgey
current strategy is to develop a method to first tokenize a sequence, then embed into a vecgtor space, and classify using a model. I have 3 classification tasks in mind - Transcribed vs nontranscribed, protein coding vs non coding, and protein family clasiification
